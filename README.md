# Refviewer-2014

Using D3, we [re-implemented some of the excellent REFViewer](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~jwo/refviewer/) built by Jo Wood of the giCentre at City, University of London.

[Research Excellence Framework (REF)](https://www.ref.ac.uk/) scores represent the quality of research at each UK institution using the 2008 assessment. Darker green colours of the bar chart represent higher quality research scores either as a proportion of submitted staff ('Scale by staff %') or by the volume of staff submitted ('Scale by staff counts'). Toggle the buttons below to animate changes.
